### Smart Waste Management System 

OVERVIEW: 
Smart waste management is about using technology and data to create a more efficient waste industry. Based on IoT (Internet of Things) technology, 
smart waste management aims to optimize resource allocation, reduce running costs, and increase the sustainability of waste services.



Technical Stack: 
Languages: C++, Java
Algorithms: Dijkstra‚Äôs, A*, Rabin Karp, Kruskal's, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

Impact:
1. Environmental Benefits
Reduces landfill waste, emissions, and promotes recycling for a cleaner environment.
2. Cost Efficiency
Optimizes collection routes and reduces operational and maintenance costs.
3. Public Health Improvement
Minimizes risks of disease by ensuring proper waste disposal and cleanliness.
4. Community Engagement
Encourages citizen participation through apps, incentives, and educational campaigns.
5. Resource Recovery
Enhances recycling and energy recovery from waste materials.
6. Technological Advancements
Leverages IoT, AI, and data analytics for efficient waste management.
7. Energy Conservation
Reduces fuel consumption and recycles waste into energy sources like biogas.
8. Economic Growth
Creates jobs and revenue streams through recycling and composting industries.
